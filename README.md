Data
Explain the dataset you are using, its format, and sources. For example, you may have labeled data with news articles and their labels (real or fake).

Preprocessing
Detail the data preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, tokenization, and any specific techniques used for this dataset.

Feature Extraction
Explain the feature extraction methods. Common techniques include TF-IDF, Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), or more advanced methods like BERT embeddings.

Model Training
Describe the machine learning or deep learning models you have implemented. Provide instructions on how to train the models using your dataset.

Evaluation
Explain the metrics used for model evaluation, e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or AUC-ROC. Provide example code to evaluate the models.

Usage
Show how to use the trained model for fake news detection. Provide code examples and instructions for making predictions on new data.

Contributing
Explain how others can contribute to the project, including guidelines for code contributions and issue reporting.

License
